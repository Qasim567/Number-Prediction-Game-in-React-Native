Number Guessing Game App
Welcome to the Number Guessing Game App! This simple mobile app allows users to play a guessing game where they have to predict a number generated by the app within a specified range. 
The app provides feedback to the user, indicating whether the generated number is higher or lower than their guess. The app then iteratively refines its prediction based on user feedback
and ultimately reveals the user's chosen number, along with the number of attempts it took to guess correctly.

Features
Users can enter any number between 1 and 99 as their chosen number.
The app generates a random number within the specified range (1-99).
Users receive feedback on whether the generated number is higher or lower than their chosen number.
The app uses a prediction algorithm to refine its guesses based on user feedback.
The app reveals the user's chosen number and the number of attempts it took to guess correctly.
